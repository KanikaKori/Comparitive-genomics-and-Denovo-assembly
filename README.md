# Comparative Genomic Analysis and De Novo Assembly of Rice Data

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains codes and detailed explanations for performing **comparative genomic analysis** and **de novo assembly** using rice sequencing data.  
It is designed to guide researchers through preprocessing, assembly, and downstream analysis workflows commonly used in plant genomics.

## 🌾 Dataset
The analyses are based on **rice (Oryza spp.) sequencing data**, focusing on:
- Comparative genomic analysis between rice varieties/strains  
- De novo transcriptome/genome assembly for rice data  

*(Note: Raw sequencing data is not included here. Please use your own or publicly available rice datasets.)*

## ⚙️ Contents
- **`.docx`** – Word file containing:
  - Step-by-step codes
  - Explanations of each command
  - Workflows for comparative genomics and de novo assembly
